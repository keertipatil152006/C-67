THE MONKEY AND THE LION

There was the lion in the forest. One day this lion was angry and he met a young monkey. So, he thought he would eat this monkey 
instead of being hungry all the time.So, he said to the monkey I haven't found anything to eat this day I know you are not enough 
for me but i am going to eat you young monkey. The monkey was in a big problem but found a way to run from the lion.He changed the
subject and said do you want to play together the game that your father and my father used to play because they were friends.
So, the lion said that intersting I didn't know that.The monkey and the lion went to an big area that had machines because the 
monkey said that I have to find machines to play.The monkey said the rules of the game are I am going first what you have to do 
instead just hang me when I throw myself down and be careful of me. The lion said okay friend be safe.
