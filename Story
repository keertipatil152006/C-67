THE MONKEY AND THE LION

There was the lion in the forest. One day this lion was angry and he met a young monkey. So, he thought he would eat this monkey 
instead of being hungry all the time.So, he said to the monkey I haven't found anything to eat this day I know you are not enough 
for me but i am going to eat you young monkey. The monkey was in a big problem but found a way to run from the lion.
